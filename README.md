# YT-AutoScribe

This project aims to build a Windows desktop tool that downloads audio from YouTube,
transcribes it locally using Whisper via Ollama with speaker diarisation,
and converts the transcripts into colour-coded SRT subtitle files.

The repository currently contains scaffolding code for future development.
